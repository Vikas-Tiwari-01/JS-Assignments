        //Some Points 
        //1.The constant variable must be initialized with it's declaration,it will throw an error if we decide to initalize it afterwards
        //2.The main objective of using var and let is the scope of the varaibles,let keyword have scope within the block only whereas the var keyword has global accessbility
        //3.Constant Arrays can take many values, we can add elements to it but we cannot alter it's values
